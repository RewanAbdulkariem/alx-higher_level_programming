# Python Import & Modules

## Description
This project focuses on Python programming concepts related to importing modules, working with command-line arguments, and using functions from external files. The repository contains several Python scripts, each with specific tasks and learning objectives.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the benefits of Python programming.
- Import functions from external Python files.
- Effectively use imported functions.
- Create Python modules.
- Utilize the built-in `dir()` function.
- Prevent code execution when imported.
- Work with command line arguments in Python.

## Files
- **0-add.py**: Imports and uses the `add` function from `add_0.py` to perform addition.
- **1-calculation.py**: Imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs various mathematical operations.
- **2-args.py**: Prints the number of command line arguments and their values.
- **3-infinite_add.py**: Computes the sum of all command line arguments.
- **4-hidden_discovery.py**: Prints all names defined in the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
- **5-variable_load.py**: Imports the variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Pycodestyle 2.8.* for code style compliance

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run each script using the following format:
   ```bash
   ./script_name.py

## Example

- To run the `0-add.py` script, open your terminal and execute the following command:
  ```bash
  $ ./0-add.py

- The output will display the result of adding 1 and 2:
   1 + 2 = 3
## Resources

Here are some helpful resources for understanding the topics covered in this project:

- [Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) - Learn about Python modules and how to import functions from other files.

- [Python Standard Library - Command Line Arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#command-line-arguments) - Explore the Python standard library documentation to understand how to work with command line arguments in Python programs.

- [Pycodestyle - Style Guide for Python Code](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) - Pycodestyle is a tool that helps you adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for writing clean and readable Python code.

These resources provide valuable information and reference materials to deepen your understanding of the concepts covered in this project.
