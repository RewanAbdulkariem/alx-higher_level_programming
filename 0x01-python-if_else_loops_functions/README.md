## Concepts
In this project, we explore the following programming concepts:
- If/else statements
- Loops (while and for loops)
- Functions
- Conditional statements (e.g., checking for positive/negative numbers)
- String formatting
  
## Resources
To complete this project, we used the following resources:

## Tasks
The project is divided into multiple tasks, each addressing a specific programming challenge. Below is a list of the tasks included in this project:
1. Task 1: Positive or Negative Checker
   - Description: Create a Python script that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.
2. Task 2: Last Digit Checker
   - Description: Write a Python script that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints its last digit along with certain conditions.
3. Task 3: Print Alphabet in Lowercase
   - Description: Create a Python script that prints the lowercase ASCII alphabet in a single line without a new line character.
4. Task 4: Print Alphabet without 'q' and 'e'
   - Description: Write a Python script that prints the lowercase ASCII alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e,' in one line.
5. Task 5: Print Numbers in Decimal and Hexadecimal
   - Description: Create a Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal format.
6. Task 6: Print Numbers from 00 to 99
   - Description: Write a Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 99 with specific formatting.
7. Task 7: Print Combinations of Two Digits
   - Description: Create a Python script that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
8. Task 8: Check for Lowercase Character
   - Description: Write a Python function that checks if a given character is lowercase.
9. Task 9: Convert String to Uppercase
    - Description: Implement a Python function that converts a string to uppercase.
10. Task 10: Print Last Digit of a Number
    - Description: Write a Python function that prints the last digit of a given number.
11. Task 11: Add Two Integers
    - Description: Implement a Python function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. Task 12: Calculate a^b
    - Description: Write a Python function that calculates a to the power of b and returns the value.
13. Task 13: FizzBuzz
    - Description: Create a Python function that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific conditions (Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz).
